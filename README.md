This program uses genetic algorithm to generate a optimal set of rules to be used in Intrusion Detection System.
It uses feature selection to select attributes from a newtwork data and uses the selected feature to generate a set of rules.
These set of rules are signatures for the anomalies in the network. Network data can be fed to analyse the nature of the packets and determine whether it is an attack or a normal packet.


An explanation of how these network packets are encoded in the binary and how the program works is defined in the paper present in my Git Repository named: Optimization of Rule Based Algorithm using Genetic Algorithm
